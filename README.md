This repository will demonstrate, for potential employers, good style, testing, and commenting in my code.

The repository is broken into two parts, my code and 
my typed mathematics assignments which show how I go
about writing proofs and explaining things.

For curation purposes, here are descriptions of the courses, what I learned and which files are the most interesting.

# Statistics and Probability for Computer Science

This class focused on:
Baysian probability including maximum likelihood and MAP estimates (maximum a posteriori).
Foundations of mathematical statistics including confidence intervals, chebyshev and markov inequalities.
Linear regression and common probability distributions.
Markov chains, and statistical simulation.
Introduction to machine learning including k-means clustering and gradient descent. 

The most interesting files:

Homework_12.pdf: last section
I enjoyed making and optimizing an R program that "warholizes" photographs. (That is, it applies k-means clustering to a photo to produce a photo with only n colors.)

Homework_11.pdf: 
I used a gradient descent algorithm to predict whether people had cancer. It was 82% accurate on test.

Homework_8.pdf: question 2
I used simulation to figure out how much inventory a store should order in a long-term weekly replenishment contract to maximize profits and have stable profit.

Homework_5.pdf: last section
I proved, using Bayes Theorem, that 100% of serial killers drink water.
