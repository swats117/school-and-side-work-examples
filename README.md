## school-and-side-work-examples
This repository will demonstrate, for potential employers, good style, testing, and commenting in my code.

The repository is broken into two parts, my code and 
my typed mathematics assignments which show how I go
about writing proofs and explaining things.

For curation purposes, here are descriptions of the courses, what I learned and which files are most interesting.

## Statistics and Probability for Computer Science

This class focused on:
* Baysian probability including maximum likelihood and MAP estimates (maximum a posteriori).
* Foundations of mathematical statistics including confidence intervals, chebyshev and markov inequalities.
* Linear regression and common probability distributions.
* Markov chains, and statistical simulation.
* Introduction to machine learning including k-means clustering and gradient descent. 

The most interesting files:

Homework_12.pdf: last section  
I enjoyed making and optimizing an R program that "warholizes" photographs. (That is, it applies k-means clustering to a photo to produce a photo with only n colors.)

Homework_11.pdf:  
I used a gradient descent algorithm to predict whether people had cancer. It was 82% accurate on test.

Homework_8.pdf: question 2  
I used simulation to figure out how much inventory a store should order in a long-term weekly replenishment contract to maximize profits and have stable profit.

## Introduction to Proofs

This class focused on:
* Formal predicate logic and set theory.
* Proof techniques including: straight forward, induction (strong and weak), contradiction, method of descent.
* Formal functions, including proving bijections, relations and their connection to set theory, cardinality and infinite sets.
* Sequences and series, partial sum formula derivation, cauchy sequences and formal limits.
* Number theory, including Euclid's algorithm and fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

The most interesting files:

MATH_347_HW5.pdf: the first problem  
I prove there are as many real numbers between 0 and 1 as there are real numbers.

MATH_347_HW9.pdf: 1.2 and 1.4  
I build up the mathematical framework necessary to prove x^3+5x is divisible by 6 when x is an integer.
Then I show 13^21+14^14 is a composite number.

## Introduction to Combinatorics

Combinatorics: advanced counting  
Combinatorics: the study of the size of finite sets under certain constraints.

This class focused on:
* Combinations, permutations, the multiplication and addition rules, and the "stars and bars" technique.
* The "pigeon hole principle" (strong and weak), using invariant/statistical properties with induction or contradiction.
* How to think combinatorially, that is, the use of stories to prove sets have the same size.
* The binomial theorem (positive and negative), the multinomial theorem.
* The inclusion exclusion principle (PIE) and complementary PIE including the "probleme des menages."
* Generating series, exponential generating series, and the Euler-Gauss identity.

The most interesting files:

MATH_413_HW5.pdf: Q11 and Q28  
I show how to use combinatorial thinking to prove an identity which is near-impossible to prove with algebra.

MATH_413_HW9.pdf: Q4  
I use a Young Tableu argument to prove an Euler-Gauss identity.
